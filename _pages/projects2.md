Executive Summary
* We performed two logistic regressions and created a decision tree assessing the impact of social support on the odds of suspension among 10th grade urban youth. Our findings suggest: 
	* Having social support among friends who dropped out of school significantly increased the log odds of suspension. 
	* Attending a highly competitive school decreased the log odds of suspension.
	* When interaction terms were introduced, gender (specifically being female) and having friends drop out was associated with an increase in the log odds of being suspended. Typically, females are less likely to be suspended.
