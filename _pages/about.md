I am a data scientist for social good and a PhD student in Social Welfare and Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering Program at University of California, Berkeley. I am also a data consultant for the Data-intensive Social Sciences Lab (D-Lab) here.

I usually apply open access data or administrative data and data science tools to explore how we can make these open data benefit benefit for the welfare system or the public. Currently, I focus on nonprofit ann other type of organization like social enterprise development for underprivileged population or in vulnerable location. My research interests are community engagement and assessment, nonprofit development, migrant well-being, community database and computational social welfare. I am also a big fan of geographic information system(GIS).
