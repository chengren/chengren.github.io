I am a data scientist for social good and a Ph.D. student in Social Welfare and Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering Program at the University of California, Berkeley. I am also a data consultant for the Data-intensive Social Sciences Lab (D-Lab) here.

I usually apply for open access data or administrative data and data science tools to explore how we can make these open data benefit for the welfare system or the public. Currently, I focus on nonprofit and other types of organizations like social enterprise development for the underprivileged population or in a vulnerable location. My research interests are community engagement and assessment, nonprofit development, migrant well-being, community database, and computational social welfare. I am also a big fan of geographic information systems (GIS).
